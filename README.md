# Z3_TemperatureSensor
This repository holds documentation and implementation on how to create a simple Temperature Sensor on a thunderboard Sense 2

In order to proceed, you will need to download EmberZNet SDK through Simplicity Studio
The SDK's access can only be requested using the serial number coming from this development kit :
[SLWSTK6000B](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/zigbee/efr32mg-zigbee-thread-starter-kit)

At the time of writing, this is done using Simplicity Studio v4 and GSDK 2.7.8
